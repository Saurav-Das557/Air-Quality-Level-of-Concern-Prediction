# AQI Prediction Using Machine Learning Models

In this project, I performed an AQI (Air Quality Index) prediction using various machine learning models. The models tested include:

- **Random Forest**
- **Decision Tree**
- **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**
- **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Naive Bayes**

## Model Performance

The bar chart below displays the performance of each model. The performance metric used is accuracy, and each model's prediction results were compared based on their respective scores.

![Model Performance](![result](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e99031e-e5af-415e-97c4-abb8a4c83f8a))

From the chart, we can observe how each model performs and analyze which one provides the best prediction accuracy for the AQI.

## Conclusion

Based on the performance metrics, further adjustments can be made to improve the predictive accuracy, including parameter tuning or trying different algorithms.
